# Geospatial Analysis Homebrew Tap

This a [Homebrew tap] containing a collection of [Homebrew][] and [Homebrew Cask][] "formulae" that can be used for activities related to work with [geospatial data][geospatial wiki].

## Usage

First, add this tap to Homebrew.  This will clone the tap repository and symlink all of its formulae.

```bash
brew tap straxhaber/geospatial
```

Now you can work on those formulae as if they were in the canonical Homebrew and Homebrew cask repositories:

```bash
brew cask install geoda
brew cask install qgis
```
